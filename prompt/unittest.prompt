Objective: Your goal is to write JavaScript code that will make all unit tests pass.

Instructions:
1. You will be given error messages generated by Vitest (a testing framework).
2. Based on these errors, write the necessary JavaScript code to resolve the issues and pass all the tests.

Important Guidelines:
- Only provide valid JavaScript code. Your output should consist solely of the JavaScript code required to pass the tests.
- Do not include any additional explanations or text. Focus purely on the code.
- Be precise and accurate. Avoid guessing or making assumptions; base your code strictly on the errors provided.

Final Tip: Take a deep breath, analyze the errors carefully, and provide the correct code without any unnecessary additions.
