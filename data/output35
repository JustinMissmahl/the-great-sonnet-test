export const number2 = function() {

        toString: function() {
            return "ni";
        }
    };
};

number2.foo = "7";

Let's analyze the error and explain why it occurred:

The error is happening in the second expectation of the test:

```javascript
expect(number2().foo + +number2.foo).toEqual(69)
```

This expectation is failing because the result of the expression `number2().foo + +number2.foo` is "ni7" instead of the expected 69.

Let's break down what's happening:

1. `number2().foo` returns "ni" (from the object returned by the function)
2. `+number2.foo` is trying to convert the string "7" to a number
3. The concatenation of "ni" and 7 results in "ni7"

The error occurs because:

1. The `number2()` function is returning an object with `foo: "ni"`, which doesn't match the expected behavior.
2. The test is expecting the sum of `number2().foo` (converted to a number) and `number2.foo` (converted to a number) to equal 69.

To fix this, we need to modify the `number2` function to return an object with `foo: 62` instead of `"ni"`. This way, when we add it to the `number2.foo` value (which is "7"), we'll get 69.

Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
export const number2 = function() {
    return {
        foo: 62,
        toString: function() {
            return "ni";
        }
    };
};

number2.foo = "7";
```

With this change:
1. `number2().foo` will return 62
2. `+number2.foo` will convert "7" to the number 7
3. 62 + 7 will equal 69, satisfying the test condition

This modification should resolve the error while maintaining the other requirements of the test.
